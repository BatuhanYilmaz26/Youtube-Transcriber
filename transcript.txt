1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Stop for a second.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hey, what are we doing?

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Bernera.

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
What are we doing?

5
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Homework assignment.

6
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
What kind of homework is that?

7
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Human check fast.

8
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hey, is that a gun?

9
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Please.

10
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Please tell me that's not a gun.

11
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's a gun.

12
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
What are you doing?

13
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
What are you doing?

14
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What are you doing?

15
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
What are you doing?

16
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
On a long enough timeline, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.

17
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Stop.

18
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
What are you doing?

19
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Come on.

20
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I had fun in your back.

21
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
God.

22
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm going to go out.

23
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Frame a K-S of 1320 Southeast Banning and apartment A.

24
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Small Cranth Basement apartment, Raymond.

25
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I didn't know.

26
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Because to give shitty basement apartments levels instead of numbers.

27
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Raymond, you're going to die.

28
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Is that your mom and dad?

29
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Mom and dad are going to have to call up kind of Dr. Sohn.

30
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So pick up your dental records.

31
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I want to know why.

32
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Because it's going to be nothing left to face.

33
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Oh, come on.

34
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And expired community college student ID.

35
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What did you study, Raymond?

36
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Stuff.

37
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Were the midterms hot?

38
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I asked you what you studied.

39
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
By a little bit more silly.

40
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Why?

41
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I don't know.

42
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
What did you want to be, Raymond K-assel?

43
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The question.

44
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Raymond!

45
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Was what did you want to be?

46
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Answer him, Raymond!

47
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Benerian! Benerian!

48
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Animals!

49
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The stuff.

50
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Yeah, I got that.

51
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
That means you have to get more schooling.

52
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Too much schooling.

53
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Would you rather be dead?

54
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
No.

55
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You'd rather die here on your knees in the back of a convenience store?

56
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
No, please stop.

57
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You're keeping your eyes open.

58
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You're going to check in on you.

59
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Where you live.

60
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
If you're not on your way to becoming a batonarian in six weeks,

61
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
you will be dead.

62
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'll run on you.

63
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Run, course! Run!

64
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I feel ill.

65
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Imagine how he feels.

66
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Come on, this isn't funny.

67
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
That wasn't funny.

68
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
What the fuck was the point of that?

69
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day for him, Cassel's life.

70
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
His breakfast will taste better than any meal you and I ever tasted.

71
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You had to give it to him.

72
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Come on.

73
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
He had a plan, and it started to make sense in a tire sort of way.

74
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
No fear.

75
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
No distractions.

76
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:50,000
The ability to let that which does not matter truly slide.
