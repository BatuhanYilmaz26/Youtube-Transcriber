1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Look around there, look around. I see a lot of new faces.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Shut up!

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Which means a lot of you have been breaking the first two rules of Fight Club.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Man, I see in Fight Club the strongest and smartest men who have ever lived.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I see all this potential.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And I see a squander.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables, slaves with white
collars.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Advertising, hesitation, cars and clothes. Working jobs we hate so we can buy
shit we don't need.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We're the middle children of history, man. No purpose, no place.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We have no great war, no great depression.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Our great war is a spiritual war. Our great depression is our lives.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be
millionaires and movie gods and rock stars.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
But we won't.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
We're slowly learning that fact and we're very, very pissed off.
