00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
 Look around there, look around. I see a lot of new faces.

00:06.000 --> 00:07.000
 Shut up!

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
 Which means a lot of you have been breaking the first two rules of Fight Club.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
 Man, I see in Fight Club the strongest and smartest men who have ever lived.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.000
 I see all this potential.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
 And I see a squander.

00:31.000 --> 00:38.000
 God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables, slaves with
white collars.

00:41.000 --> 00:47.000
 Advertising, hesitation, cars and clothes. Working jobs we hate so we can buy
shit we don't need.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
 We're the middle children of history, man. No purpose, no place.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
 We have no great war, no great depression.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.000
 Our great war is a spiritual war. Our great depression is our lives.

01:12.000 --> 01:18.000
 We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be
millionaires and movie gods and rock stars.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
 But we won't.

01:19.000 --> 01:26.000
 We're slowly learning that fact and we're very, very pissed off.
